# River.news

[River.news](http://river.news) is a Javascript *server-less* application which shows how to use the Superfeedr' [feed API](http://documentation.superfeedr.com/subscribers.html) to build a very basic feed reader. It's fully functional and can be used as a single person RSS reader as its store your Superfeedr credentials in your browser's localstorage.

It uses [Reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for its code, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for its layout.


## Building

If you change the `src/*.jsx` files, run `jsx -w -x jsx src/ site/js/`!
